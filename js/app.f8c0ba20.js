This week\'s book was "I Love Capitalism!" and it was a very\n                    inspiring and eye-opening journey into why capitalism is so effective.'},{date:"02/09/2019",title:"Learning A New Framework, Two Job Offers, And A Brand New Opportunity!",body:"This week has been amazing with respect to the job search. I actually received two job\n                    offers on the same day (Monday) and it was definitely a confidence booster. I needed some time\n                    to think about them though because, even though these were excellent companies, I have really\n                    been focusing a lot on culture and teamwork due to all of the reading I have been doing. That\n                    being said, I really do not know if these companies really have the culture I am looking for.\n                    However, all hope is not lost. I actually found an amazing opportunity by randomly hopping on\n                    my home city's Slack channel at a company I had never heard of. After looking at the company's\n                    website, I knew this was definitely a company I could see myself working for for the long term.\n                    They are doing something truly innovative in an industry that I have always been very involved\n                    with. I had call with them earlier this week and I have very high hopes for this opportunity. In\n                    fact, on the call, I found out about a new book that their company holds to a very high\n                    standard, \"The Ideal Team Player\". After the call concluded, the first thing I did was order the\n                    book on Amazon. Luckily the very next day it arrived at my house and I was so excited that I\n                    read it twice this week! The book was so good that I ended up ordering all the other books by\n                    its author, Patrick Lencioni. I am determined to have a position with this company and literally\n                    dedicate all of my time to it. Some of the details of the job included working with React. I am\n                    a big Vue fan (which is what this site was built with) but I am always open to trying out a new\n                    framework. So the majority of this week has been dedicated to familiarizing myself with React."},{date:"02/16/2019",title:"Made A Bold Move",body:"I ended up turning down both job offers that were made to me in favour of other company\n                    that I was so excited about last week. At first, I was a bit uncomfortable with this decision\n                    (turning down two guaranteed positions for one potential opportunity) but I definitely stand by\n                    my decision and realize now that it was for the best either way. You see, I really want to be\n                    passionate about the company I am working for. That being said, going forward, I will only be\n                    applying to jobs that I am truly passionate about. For the time being, I am going to totally\n                    dedicate myself to this new opportunity and do everything within my power to get a position\n                    there."},{date:"02/23/2019",title:"Extremely Excited",body:"I am excited to say that I have gotten through the off-site interviews for the company I\n                    have been talking about for the past few posts. In fact, I have an on-site interview in just a\n                    few days! I am extremely excited and definitely looking forward to meeting the team. I am also\n                    extremely nervous because I feel like this is the biggest moment of my life and I do not want to\n                    mess a single thing up."},{date:"03/02/2019",title:"Analysis Of February 2019",body:"First things first, I feel that the on-site interview went really well with the company I\n                    have been mentioning. I am very nervous and also very excited. I am going over all the things I\n                    could have potentially done better in the interview, but I know it is all out of my hands for\n                    now. I just have to patiently await their response. I am very hopeful and know it would be\n                    life-changing for this opportunity to manifest into a job. As far as updates on my other\n                    non-employment goals for February: I am still reading books (I actually go through three this\n                    week!), I have put my browser game on the back burner in order to fully focus on this wonderful\n                    job opportunity, and I have finally picked out a non-programming language to learn...Japanese.\n                    Kind of random, but my sister is actually planning a trip to Japan this fall and she is also\n                    attempting to learn Japanese so I thought what better way to learn a new language than to learn\n                    it with someone else! With learning anything new, I find it best to have as many people around\n                    you to hold you accountable, so we shall see what comes of this!"},{date:"03/09/2019",title:"Excited, Humbled, And Looking Forward To The Future",body:"I LANDED MY DREAM JOB! The company I have been referring to throughout my past few posts\n                    has offered me a position and words cannot describe how thrilled I am. Six years of sleepless\n                    nights in college has finally paid off and I could not be happier. My official start date with\n                    the company is April 1st and I do not know if it would be in bad taste to say the name of the\n                    company just yet, so I will hold off on that until my official start date. I am still in\n                    disbelief but, at the same time, I have never wanted something so bad in my life and it has\n                    finally become a reality. I already made a post about this a week ago (today is actually 03/16)\n                    but somehow (via an error with git ._.) the post I had made was deleted. However, I am still\n                    super excited about securing the position and I hope it is still apparent; actually, I do not\n                    think I will ever stop being excited about this position. Plus the CEO of the company\n                    recommended an AMAZING book for me to read, which was my reading for this week, and I was also\n                    recommended another book by the team, which I am still waiting on."},{date:"03/16/2019",title:"Free Pizza For A Year And Learning React",body:"This week was surprising to say the least. I started off just preparing for my new\n                    position (studying frameworks, sharpening my skills, learning new technologies) and read reading,\n                    as usual. When Thursday (pi day) rolled around, though, something very unexpected happened. I\n                    entered a pizza eating competition at Gino's East in Nashville, a new Chicago-style pizza place,\n                    and won! We (the three competitors) were to consume a 9-inch deep dish pizza within five\n                    minutes. I actually found out about the contest by being tagged in an Instagram post and, with\n                    that, I was implicitly entered. Now I have always had a pretty big appetite and I eat\n                    noticeably faster than those around me, but even I did not think it would be possible to\n                    consume an entire deep dish pizza within five minutes. Somehow I was able to do it and it was\n                    actually recorded but I do not know if the footage is something that should ever see the light\n                    of day; eating an entire pizza within five minutes is definitely not the most pleasant thing to\n                    watch. In other non-pizza-related news, I built a small React app just to familiarize myself\n                    with it again. I have been using Vue so much that I actually forgot how nice React is. I have\n                    been considering redoing this site in React if nothing more than just for the practice, but I am\n                    still undecided on that. If I do, it will not be for a while because I have quite a bit to learn\n                    for my job.
